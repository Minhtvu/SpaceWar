# SpaceWar
A space combat video game developed in 1962 by Steve Russell, but extended to have more functionalities and a different view.

Two players will be able to fight against each other, and scores are displayed for statistical purpose. Each player should try to shoot the opponent, and avoid from falling into the gravity well (X)

For player one, use Up for shooting, Down for thrusting, Left and Right for rotating, and Delete for teleporting.
For player two, use W for shooting, S for thrusting, A and D for rotating, and Q for teleporting.

The missile and the fuel available will be displayed, and teleporting also has its own cooldown time.
